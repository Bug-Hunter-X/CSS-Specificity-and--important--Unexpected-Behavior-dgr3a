The solution to this issue is to avoid using `!important` whenever possible and to properly manage CSS specificity.  Here's how the CSS can be rewritten to avoid the unexpected behavior:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}
```

By removing the `!important` declaration from the `.child` selector, the expected behavior is restored, and the text will now correctly display as green because the more specific selector `.parent .child` takes precedence.
